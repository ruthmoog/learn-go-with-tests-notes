*Testing syntax tips...*

- test files are suffixed with _SOMENAME_`_test.go`
- the test func starts with `Test`_SomeName_
- `t` is the hook to the testing framework with methods like `t.Fail()` and `t.Errorf(...)`
  - the testing framework gives you a `t` you can call methods on
- `*testing.TB` is an interface combo of `T` test and `B` benchmark
- `t.Helper` required for safe debugging with helper methods

*General testing tips...*

- use subtests to triangulate on a general behaviour
- you can include examples in test files
  - ```go
    func ExampleAdd() {
    sum := Add(1, 5)
    fmt.Println(sum)
    // Output: 6
    }
```

*General Go tips...*

- command for running `go test` is `go mod init SOMENAME`
- declare vars with `:=`
- build a string with placeholder values `%q` (q: double quotes)
- define constants with `const`
- Use a _named return value_ and avoid explicitly declaring it in the method body
  - it will be assigned the empty value of the type, eg `""` or `0`
  - `return` will return the _named return value_, no need to explicitly return the var
  - it will be automatically added to the Go Doc
- public funcs are announced in `PascalCase` and private funcs are whispered in `camelCase`

**TDD Cycle**

1. Write a test -> Make compiler pass 
2. Run the test -> Check the error message
3. Write enough to make it pass
4. Refactor
